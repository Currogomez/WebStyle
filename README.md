# 🤖 Web Design Bot – Create Websites Easily

**WebStyle 2.0** is an open-source bot for the Telegram app that uses artificial intelligence to provide real-time assistance in basic web design (HTML, CSS, and some simple JavaScript).

The bot interacts with users through the Telegram chat, guiding them step by step to create a personalized website.  
The main idea is to make web design accessible to individuals and small businesses without the need for advanced programming knowledge or expensive tools.

With **WebStyle 2.0** (an improved version over the previous one), the goal is to demonstrate that it is possible to create a creative project without spending a lot of money or resources.
